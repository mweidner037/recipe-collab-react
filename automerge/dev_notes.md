1. For reusable components that accept & mutate a part of a doc, it seems like they need to input a "path" and prefix all operations with that path - unlike the top-level component, which gets to work with the doc directly. It would be nice to have a wrapper that hides this difference: e.g., a function `prefix(doc, changeDoc, path)` that returns a scoped `[doc, changeDoc]`, or a way to embed a path in a document URL so that `useDocument` "just works".
